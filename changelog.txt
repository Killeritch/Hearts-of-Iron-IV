# Stability & Performance
##################################
- Fixed small memory leak.
- Fixed uninitialized variable in graphical settings, which in theory could cause an undefined game behaviour.
- Fixed CTD when loading a savegames which was related to the air wings.
- Fixed OOS caused by "local resistance" data not being properly cleared.
- Improved initial loading time a bit. The naval distance calculations are much faster, and is done only once (or whenever a game changes has been detected that could affect the naval distance calcluations). At every next game start, the loading process skips the naval distance calculations by just loading the cached data.
- Fixed peace conference behavior and crash in the case that one or more of the winners have been occupied by a different winning faction.
- Fixed SS recruitment crashing the game under very specific circumstances.
- Fixed CTD when asking a lend lease to some AI countries within the first day of the game.

- Attempt to gracefully skip over opponents who are no longer at war with each other when cleaning up war relations at the conclusion of a peace conference.  This avoids crashes when multiple peace conferences get initiated and completed simultaneously, especially due to scripted white peace events.
- Ensured all buildings in the newly-changed Polish and German states are present in those states, to avoid crashes.
- Fixed CTD on create_unit effect with invalid template name. Now shows an error instead.
- Mod files created through the launcher tool, are now UTF8-BOM to avoid errors when using the file later.

- Added an error and prevented a crash if a supply area is missing
- Fixed crash when loading a savegame while in a peace conference
- Fixed crash when adding manpower to casualties when the killer was not at war with the owner of the manpower ( for instance volunteers ), casualties will now be added to the logicalcountry of the army in such situations
- Fixed memory leak due to old messages piling up over time that were never used
- Optimized the amount of calculations related to front systems (base mechanics required by the battleplans) used by the volunteers battleplans.
- Optimized a function that was doing a "country tag lookup" (an internal thing) which was a bottleneck at some moments of gameplay.
- Fixed CTD and by the way the inconsistency between the ordinary AI, and the volunteers AI.
- Lots of memory leaks fixes in general (Leaked memory means that the game consumes more and more RAM over the time).
- Fixed several CTDs in a new division names system.
- Fixed CTDs that occured after loading the older save games.

- Fixed CTD in AI strategy referring to the leaders being deleted by spawning a civil war.
- Fixed invalid access to a deleted memory in the decision status (making very low probability for a CTD).
- Fixed CTD in going back to main menu. Airbase access code was referring to the carriers after deleting them.
- Huge optimizations in how we calculate the relative air superiority. This unlocks plenty of bottlenecks in: units, navies, air calculations (and much more)...
- Another large performance optimization in the naval unit transportation system.
- Optimized the amount of the network commands spammed by the AI.
- Small optimization in pathfinding for the naval transportation. Units ready to set off from the same location will get only 1 naval pathfind done and share the data.
- Optimized performance by about 20% in places by reworking the careless usage of "can battleplans be executed" function.
- Got rid of the several seconds stall on daily updates. Related to the sending/receiving volunteer forces.

- Fixed CTD caused by incorrect re-assignment of the armies between the theatres.
- Fixed CTD if you launch the game "hoi4.exe -start_tag=ABC" where ABC is an invalid country tag.

- Fixed crash that happens after loading older saves, or by removing some insignias in patches/mods.
- Fixed rare CTD after deleting defensive line.
- Fixed several Out of Sync bugs in MP.
- Fixed OOS from pinned strat.regions mismatch after hotjoin.

- Fixed a division by zero crash
- Fixed crash that happens on rare occasions when sending telemetry data
- added crash safety checks for invalid data on writing sunk ships to savegame
- Fixed CTD when naval transfering units during a peace conference annexing you (and killing said units at the same time as orders were given, as a side note also invented a time machine and solved world hunger.)
- Fixed memory overrun issue in ai front handling
- Portraits and other sprite updates are now cached to reduce ui strain
- Fixed an issue where deleted units could be put back into combats.
- fixed an issue where licensing information was not read in an MP safe format and could cause OOS

- Fixed hotjoin related OOS with resources and relations
- Fix for a freeze when you ended up in a civil war at war with your own puppets (o_O). Fix stops all inter-faction wars so modders need to be careful to kick ppl before war etc.

- AI is now MUCH better at looking at the equipment cost for switching more templates than just one at a time 
- AI cares about infrastructure way more when placing consctruction
- AI should no longer go as happy on naval construction over military (was counting ratio also using civilian so got disproportional large naval part)
- AI us now allowed to trade using more civilian factories
